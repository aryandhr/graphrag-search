NOTE: When using flashing, spray \nadhesive/primer, sealant and foam products, we recommend \nusing the same manufacturer and verifying compatibility. It is the \nEnd User’s responsibility to determine if dissimilar materials are \ncompatible with the substrates in the application. • Sill pan: A pan flashing system (as defined in ASTM E2112) is requir ed \nat the sill prior to window/door product installation. A sill pan should \nhave a positive slope, must be installed onto the sill of the R.O. in a \nweather-tight manner and tied into the drainage plane of the building \nenvelope. For sill pans without a positive slope, place a 3/16"-1/4" tall \nplastic shim 2" from each corner and no more than 8" on-center in \nbetween (excludes Canada and potentially large door systems). If an \naftermarket sill pan is preferred, then we suggest the Manufacturer’s \ninstructions be followed. \n• Sealant: An exterior grade (High-Performing, Low VOC) sealant \nis recommended for installation practices. Check with sealant \nmanufacturers for color-match options and paintability. \n• Polyurethane Low-Expansion Window and Door Foam: A low-\nexpansion, polyurethane window and door foam is recommended for \ninstallation practices. Avoid using moderate to high-expansion foam \nproducts as operational issues or damage may occur. \n• Backer Rod: 1/8" larger than the widest portion of the gap (used in \nconjunction with sealant bead for interior air seal). \n• Non-compressible, non-water degradable shims. \n• Drip cap (if not supplied). \nPotential Needed Tools \n• Utility knife/shears \n• J-roller \n• Hammer \n• Tape measure • Caulking gun \n• Level (4\' minimum recommended) \n• Drill with bits \n• Pry bar \nRemove Packaging \n• Remove shipping materials such as corner covers, shipping blocks, \nshrink wrap or pads. If there is a protective film on the glass, DO NOT \nremove it until installation and construction is complete. \n• DO NOT remove the installation label until after the inspection of the \njob is\xa0complete. If any of the above conditions represent a concern, or if you expect \nenvironmental conditions to exceed the window’s performance \nrating, DO NOT install the window. Contact your dealer or distributor \nfor\xa0recommendations. Needed Materials \n• #8 pan-head/ washer-head (or larger diameter head), corrosion-resistant \nscrew OR 1 3/4" galvanized roofing nails.

The distinctive raised panel design, while aesthetically pleasing, required specific handling procedures to prevent surface damage during installation.\nCritical Installation Notes\nThe 129-inch height specification created unique challenges in residential applications, particularly in older homes with non-standard ceiling heights. Installation teams found that the 16 inch thickness provided excellent stability but required precise measurements for the 23.75-inch width clearance.\nHardware Compatibility Issues\nThe Home Depot-specific hardware package included with these units had compatibility concerns with existing track systems. The fiber construction of both the center stile and outer rails meant that standard mounting screws could strip the material if over-torqued.\nQuality Control Observations\nField reports from early 2008 installations noted that the hollow core construction, while meeting TSCA Title VI compliance standards, was sensitive to humidity changes. The composite molded material expanded differently than traditional wood products, requiring adjusted tolerance specifications.\nContractor Training Updates\nFollowing the initial rollout, additional training was provided to installation crews regarding the unique properties of the fiber stile and rail construction. The "Good 2/S" surface finish required special cleaning procedures that differed from standard molded door maintenance.\nResolution and Best Practices\nBy mid-2008, standardized installation procedures were established for all textured colonist bifold applications. The two-door configuration proved popular in master bedroom closet applications, particularly where the distinctive colonial styling complemented traditional home decor.', 'HOME DEPOT, TEXTURED COLONIST BIFOLD CLOSET SYSTEMS, TSCA TITLE VI, 2008, INSTALLATION TEAMS, BIFOLD DOORS, HARDWARE PACK, HARDWARE, DI, RD, ZE, PART', 'Home Depot is a home improvement retailer that provides products and services for home renovation and construction, including installation services for bifold closet systems.; Textured Colonist Bifold Closet Systems are bifold doors with a distinctive raised panel design, specifically designed for residential applications.; TSCA Title VI is a regulation that sets standards for the safety of composite wood products, ensuring they meet specific environmental and health criteria.; The year 2008 marks the period during which the Home Depot contractor initiative and subsequent installation challenges occurred.; Installation teams are groups of contractors responsible for the installation of Home Depot products, including the textured colonist bifold doors.; Bifold doors are a type of door that folds in sections and are designed for fast and easy installation and adjustment.; The hardware pack contains the necessary components and instructions for installing the Siteline® Quad Panel Sliding Patio Doors.; Hardware refers to the various components used in the installation of doors, including handles, locks, and screws.; DI is an entity responsible for inventory transactions, involved in transferring and adjusting items.; RD is a product identified by item number 05459, described as an Equal 5 PNL PRIMED 3/00 X 6/08 with specific dimensions and characteristics, compliant with TSCA Title VI.; ZE is an entity involved in shipping transactions, as indicated by its presence in the shipping records.; Part is a column in the dataset that may contain text values representing subcomponents related to the parent part.', '', 'Installation Guidelines for Textured Colonist Bifold Closet Systems', 0.7166303992271423]

This part serves to engage the last panel out of \nthe pocket and form a weather seal. \nInterlock \nA weatherstrip component that runs vertically along the stiles of sliding patio \ndoor panels. When the door is closed, the interlocks engage, locking together, to \ncreate a weather barrier. \nLiquid Applied Flashing or Membrane \nA sealant-like material that is typically applied by brush or trowel to improve the \nwater-resistance of a substrate. \nPanel Bumper \nA bumper installed on the head track that acts as a panel stop. \nPanel Catch \nA square stop installed on the face of the panel that acts as a catch when \noperating a multi-panel system. \nRecessed Opening or Pocket \nA recessed wall detail that forms a cavity, or pocket, on the interior of the \nbuilding. \nSelf-Adhered Flashing (SAF) \nAn adhered-backed tape material, generally not requiring mechanical fasteners, \nused to waterproof the rough opening and/or used to seal a patio door to the \nbuilding’s weather barrier. \nShiplap \nThe layering method in which each layer overlaps the layer below it, so that \nwater runs down and to the outside. \nSill Pan \nA flashing component installed in the sill of the rough opening underneath the \ndoor. Sill pans have upturned walls along the interior edge and at both ends, \ncreating a three-sided box. This component serves as a collection device to drain \nincidental water to the exterior of the building and should be properly sealed \nto the opening. The best sill pan design has a positive slope to the exterior and \noffers continuous support to the door’s sill. \nStep-down Landing \nThe interior floor surface is higher than the exterior surface. \nWeep Hole (weep channel) \nThe visible exit or entry part of a water drainage system used to drain water out \nof a door.
